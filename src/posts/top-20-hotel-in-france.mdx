## 10. HOTEL DE LA CITE CARCASSONNE – MGALLERY BY SOFITEL

The walled city of Carcassonne stands high on a hill above the River Aude, overlooking the valley of Laurageais and the lush Minervois vineyards. It is Europe’s largest fortified citadel, each stone a mute witness to its romantic past. Standing between two historic landmarks, the Roman Chateau Comtal and the Gothic Basilica of Saint-Nazaire, the Hotel de la Cite is set in its own glorious gardens. Each of its 60 rooms and suites is individually furnished and decorated in traditional style – matched by modern comfort, and all rooms feature the most up to date facilities including air conditioning, sound-proofing, direct dial telephone and television. The decor of the hotel has been created by the celebrated designers Gerard Gallet and Jean-Michel Ley.

## 9. LE CHALET ZANNIER, MEGEVE

Nestled in a beautiful part of the Alps, Le Chalet Zannier is a delightful mountain hotel in France offering a truly luxurious experience. The welcome is personal and the accommodation sumptuous – everything you need for an unforgettable time away. Established over a vast area, the site has three alpine-style chalets, the decoration of which expresses the very essence and sophistication of the project when it was created as an “exceptional place” to stay. All different, each one of the 12 bedrooms evokes style, beauty and taste. The wellness center with its indoor swimming pool, sauna, hammam and two treatment rooms is the perfect place to relax after an enjoyable day on the slopes.

## 8. HOTEL DU PALAIS, BIARRITZ

It is a well-known fact that the villa that houses the Hotel du Palais in Biarritz, was built by Napoleon III for his wife Eugénie. Few travelers realize, however, that the Spanish-born beauty had been to Biarritz before, and that it was she who convinced her husband to visit the resort town in the first place. Today, the scarlet-and-cream-colored seaside hotel – part of the collection of Leading Hotels of the World – still channels its grand heritage. Rooms are lavish and high ceilings create a breezy, destination-appropriate vibe. Equally sumptuous is La Rotunda restaurant, where the beau monde comes for special occasion meals. The extensive wellness facility, complete with a Guerlain spa and lounging areas with sea views, is the kind of enclave that Eugénie surely would have loved.

## 7. GRAND HOTEL DU CAP FERRAT, A FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, FRENCH RIVIERA

The Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat, a Four Seasons Hotel, is located between Nice and Monaco, at the tip of the beautiful Cap-Ferrat Peninsula. The property faces the Mediterranean and is surrounded by a private 17 acre estate of pine trees and gardens with flowers of a thousand colors. Known as one of the most exclusive hotels in France, the property features 74 rooms and suites entirely renovated and redecorated by Pierre-Yves Rochon. The Residence, a contemporary addition to the hotel, offers a sea and garden front wing with eight pool suites and sixteen deluxe rooms – all with private terraces. The beach club is open from April to October, and features an Olympic-size heated sea-water pool, cabanas, water-edge deck and a private cable car to reach this spectacular facility.
